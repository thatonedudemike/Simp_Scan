# Simple Scanner Network Scanner 

***main.py needs to be ran with python3 in a terminal with sudo privileges, running inside the terminal on VS Code, Pycharm will suffice.***
***Running code within the programs themselves with the "Shift + f5 / f10" features will cause the program to fail***

This is just a simple Project for School at the moment i will be adding
 more to this eventully with new features to capture names of the devices on 
 the network as well as make the Port Scanner more in depth. 
 
 For now the scanner works and the IP/MAC scanner both work as well. 
 The Port scanner runs into a few snags when ran against things like Amazon FireSticks
 and Printers but when ran against a Computer or the Host it works as Advertised for now

As of Dec 13, 2021, if you find any issues feel free to add them

This code is going to be riddled with bugs and was not designed with any security try/excepts. 

Thank you,
